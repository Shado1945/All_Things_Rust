Stage 1: Strengthen Core Concepts (Ownership, Borrowing, Structs, Enums, Modules)

Small but powerful — each one takes a few hours.

CLI Calculator
Learn: Functions, enums, pattern matching, input parsing
➜ Build a simple command-line calculator that supports + - * / and parentheses.

Todo List App (CLI)
Learn: Structs, vectors, borrowing, file I/O
➜ Add, remove, and list tasks. Save them to a JSON or text file.

Guess the Number (Expanded)
Learn: Ownership + modularization
➜ Expand the Rust Book example — store player stats (attempts, streaks) and persist between runs.

CSV Summarizer
Learn: Reading files, error handling, iterators
➜ Load a .csv, count rows, compute averages, and print a small report.

Text Analyzer
Learn: HashMap, ownership, iterators
➜ Count word frequency in a text file (case-insensitive, ignore punctuation).

🧱 Stage 2: Structs, Traits, and Error Handling

Now you’ll get more abstract and think in Rust’s model of design.

Bank Account Simulator
Learn: Structs, traits, methods, encapsulation, lifetimes
➜ Implement deposits, withdrawals, and interest accrual with proper error handling.

Command-line Notes App
Learn: File I/O, serialization (serde), JSON
➜ Save notes with timestamps, search through them via CLI.

Mini Logger Library
Learn: Traits, generics, modules
➜ Build a small logging utility that writes to console and file.

Simple Config Parser
Learn: String parsing, enums, pattern matching
➜ Parse a .ini or .toml-like config file into a structured HashMap.

File Sync Tool (Local)
Learn: Borrowing, filesystem traversal (std::fs, walkdir)
➜ Compare two folders and list changed/missing files.

⚙️ Stage 3: Intermediate — Ownership, Concurrency, Networking

These get you into the meat of Rust.

Multithreaded Downloader
Learn: Threads, channels, reqwest crate
➜ Download multiple URLs concurrently and show progress.

Chat Server (TCP)
Learn: Networking (std::net), threads, synchronization (Mutex, Arc)
➜ Simple text-based chat server with multiple clients.

HTTP Server from Scratch
Learn: Streams, parsing, threading
➜ Handle basic GET requests and serve files from a folder.

Weather CLI App
Learn: Async, HTTP APIs, serde, tokio
➜ Fetch weather data from an API and format it nicely in the terminal.

JSON Database
Learn: Serialization, file locking, mutation safely
➜ CRUD operations on a JSON file, like a mini key-value store.

🚀 Stage 4: Advanced Projects (Async, Traits, Error Handling, Libraries)

You’ll start thinking like a real Rust engineer here.

REST API with Axum
Learn: Async, error handling, web dev patterns
➜ Build a small API with endpoints for users, todos, etc.

File Indexer (Search Engine)
Learn: Data structures, tokenization, efficient lookups
➜ Index all words in .txt files and let user search for phrases.

CLI Git Clone (Simplified)
Learn: Networking, hashing (SHA1), command execution
➜ Clone remote repos and store commits locally (simplified).

Multithreaded Image Processor
Learn: Parallelism, channels, memory management
➜ Apply grayscale or blur filters using multiple threads.

Mini Game (Text-based RPG)
Learn: Enums, state machines, modular code
➜ Simple combat system with items, enemies, and turns.
